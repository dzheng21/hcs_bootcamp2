In this project we worked with a .csv with data from Indian Liver Disease Patients that we were able to obtain using Kaggle. We used the KNN and K-Means Clustering algorithms framework from the Iris project that we did in the second bootcamp in order to achieve this. We considered 4 values, Age, Alkaline_Phosphotase, Aspartate_Aminotransferase, and Total_Protiens, and attempted to corollate these values with Age.
